# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB queries using the `$in` operator with an empty array.  The query incorrectly returns no results, even when the field exists in documents.

## Bug Description

Using `$in: []` in a MongoDB query will always result in an empty result set. This is because the `$in` operator checks if a field's value is present within the specified array. If the array is empty, no value can be present in it.

## Solution

The solution depends on your intended behavior. If you want to include documents where the field exists regardless of its value, you should use the `exists` operator. If you have a different condition to check against, you should adapt the query accordingly.
